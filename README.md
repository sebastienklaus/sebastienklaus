## Hi there, and welcome on my Github profile ! ðŸ‘‹

### Presentation

ðŸ§‘ I'm _SÃ©bastien Klaus_, a 21 years old young man passionate about web development! 

ðŸ“š Actually, I'm a LP CIASIE student in IUT Charlemagne at Nancy, France.  

ðŸ”­ In this formation, we're working on the _full sides_ of web development : front-end (HTML, CSS, JS (jQuery, AJAX), XML), back-end (PHP (Laravel)), project gestion, open-data, law of internet, network, ... so many things !  

ðŸŒ± Actually, i'm learning how to make our active record, AJAX, project gestion, open data, VueJS.

My repositories are all in private, except for some repositories (beacause of visibilty for my teachers).  

(*i'm working on this _about me_, it's not done at 100% ...*)
